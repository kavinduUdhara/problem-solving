# Problem: Finding the Missing Number
You are given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range 1 to n+1. This means there is one number missing from the sequence. Write a function to find and return the missing number.

For example:


``` python
# Example 1
arr1 = [3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]
# The missing number is 6
```

``` python
# Example 2
arr2 = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
# The missing number is 5
Your task is to implement a function:
```

```python
def find_missing_number(arr):
    # Your code here
    pass
```
The function should take an array arr as input and return the missing number.
